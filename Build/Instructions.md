Instructions:

In order to play the game in this early stage, you need to specify a working directory in the command line args with "-WorkingDirectory {PATH}".
this will look something like "-WorkingDirectory C:\Users\USERNAME\Appdata\NinjasKnightsNecromancers\GameFiles\\"

this should allow saves and other core files to be generated.

NOTE: The WorkingDirectory path must have the "GameFiles" folder specified at the end, otherwise the game can't find the "saves" folder
