Instructions:

In order to play the game in this early stage, you only need to run "GameLauncher.exe", and it will take care of the rest.

```
(Old versions require you to specify a working directory in the command line args with "-WorkingDirectory {PATH}"
this will look something like "-WorkingDirectory C:\Users\USERNAME\Appdata\NinjasKnightsNecromancers\GameFiles\\")
```

this should allow saves and other core files to be generated.

NOTE: The WorkingDirectory path must have the "GameFiles" folder specified at the end, otherwise the game can't find the "saves" folder
